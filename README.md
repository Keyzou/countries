*For ESILV - Cloud Application Development (2018 - 2019)*

This application is the front-end of [this repository](https://github.com/Keyzou/esilv-cloud). It was made by Dean Ch√©rif, Lucile Jeanneret and Matthias Exbrayat.

## Configuration

You can use a different server for the API by changing every http request in `src/pages/Home.jsx`

## Running 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
